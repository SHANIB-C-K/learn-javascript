How to learn javascript 
## Welcome to [Learn JavaScript for Free](https://github.com/SHANIBCK/learn-javascript.git)

Here, you can find the starter files for all the challenges in the course. To get started, download the entire repo and then navigate to the folder you need - the folders are structured just like the course. 

If you have any problems at all, send an email to help@scrimba.com or join our [Discord server](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) and we'll give you a hand. 

Happy coding!
